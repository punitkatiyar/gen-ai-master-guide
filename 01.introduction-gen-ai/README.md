# What is GenAI (Generative AI)?

**Generative AI (GenAI) is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content — such as text, images, audio, video, code, or even 3D designs — rather than just analyzing or processing existing data.**

- ChatGPT generates text responses.
- DALL·E, MidJourney generate images.
- GitHub Copilot generates code.
- Runway ML generates video.

# What is Traditional AI?

**Traditional AI focuses on rules, predictions, and decision-making. Instead of creating brand-new content, it’s designed to classify, recognize, and automate tasks based on existing data.**

- A spam filter in email (classifies spam vs. non-spam).
- Face recognition in security systems.
- Recommendation systems like Netflix or Amazon.
- Chess engines that decide the next best move.



> Traditional AI = Thinks and decides (analysis + prediction).

> Generative AI = Thinks, decides, and creates (new content).
